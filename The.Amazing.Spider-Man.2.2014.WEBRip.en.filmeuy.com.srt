Peter?

11
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:32,697
He likes to sleep with the lights on.

00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:37,688
Dad.

13

I have found a safe place for the night
, at Lake Geneva.

15
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:58,521
Are you uploading it?
Yes, to Roosevelt.

16
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:00,657
In case we...

17
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:03,922
It'll be fine, Mary.

18
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,445
Did you see his face?
He ​​will never understand.

19
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:11,654
Mary we've been through this
Our life as we know it is over.

20
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:15,873
We will spend every day from now on
looking over our shoulders...

21
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:18,859
never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

22
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:22,969
He's just a little boy. I know.
It's going to be alright.

23
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:26,672
It's gonna be alright.

24

No rest for the weary.

Just planning ahead.
Do you think I could speak to the pilot?

28
00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:01,479
Is there anything you need?
Perhaps I can help.

29
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:05,457
I'd just like to radio ahead, and make sure
everything's in order for when we land.

30
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:12,273

00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:37,555
It's an honor to be standing up
here today.

86
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:48,642
Hello... I told you,
I am running a bit late.

87
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:51,526
I saw the Spider

88
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:54,105
I know that we all think we're immortal
.

89
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:58,038
We're supposed to feel.
That way, We've graduated.

90
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:01,121
Like our three, four years
years in high school...

91
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:06,150
what makes life valuable, is
that it doesn't last forever.

92
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:09,930
What makes the passage is that it ends.

93
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:13,576
We know that now more than ever.

94
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,742
<i>And I say it...</i>

95
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,022
<i>today of all days</i>

To remind us that time is luck.

97
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:28,339
<i>So don't waste it, living someone elses
life.</i>

98
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,413
Make yours count for something.

99
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,269
Fight for what matters to you,
no matter what.

100
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,941
And even if we fall short...

101
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:40,662
what better way is there to live?

102
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:41,921
Alright

103
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,857

104
00:14:02,656 --> 00:14:05,256

105
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:29,013
Peter Parker

106
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:31,665
I think I know that guy.

107
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,524
Peter Parker.

108
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:37,870
Sorry.

109
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,568
Wait, do it again.

110
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,840
I was so happy myself.

111
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:59,736
I'd like to have seen that.
No, no, no

112
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:03,953
I am so proud of you.
Were you?...I'm so proud of you

113
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:08,640
I know the first thing Uncle Ben
would say... I know to.

114
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:12,768
"You got to hurry up the party's over.
You gotta go out and get a job."

115
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:16,654
And then he would say: "Don't just
follow the path. Make your own trail."

116
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,782
"Ralph Waldo Emerson... no?"

117
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,927
He said he'd made it up.

118
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:25,842
You really did learn something here.

119
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:31,490
I wish your uncle could have been here.

120
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:36,572

Don't go too far away.
Good to see you. Alright.

127
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:08,973
Did your traffic jam have anything
to do with the Russian mob...

128
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:12,059
and machine guns?

129
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:15,304
Why don't you just tell me?
When you going to give a speech.

130
00:16:15,468 --> 00:16:18,725
Gwen. Honey, family photos. Okay

133

Over and over again, all night long.

135

aunt. But I may catch up later. Thank you.

137
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:55,174
<i>You will make enemies.

<i>You have to promise me something kid </
i></i>

139
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:02,921
Leave Gwen out of this.

140
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,039
<i>Promise me that.</i>

141
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:24,618

00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:31,694
Peter.

143
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:36,467
What is it?

00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:40,769
Whats wrong? Are you alright?

145
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,324
I don't know what I'm doing.

146
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:46,874
Its my my father, right?

147
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:50,900
Yes, I see him everywhere I go

148
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:55,537
I don't know what to do.
I can't get him out of my head.

149
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:58,647
I thought We'd talked about this.
Yeah, I know...

150
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:00,877
It's not his choice.

151
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:05,071
I promised him that I would
keep away from you.

152
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:08,029
And now I'm gonnna come
and eat dinner with your family.

153
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,176
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

154
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,890
I don't know I've got No idea.

155
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:16,752
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

156
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:23,767
I thought that it would make you love me?
I do love you.

Then why isn't that enough? Hmm.

159
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,050
What if something happens to you, just
like it happened to him, because of me?

160
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,496
No, wait.

161
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:42,536
I cannot let that happen.

162
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:46,453
You are Spider-Man...

163
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:49,352
and I like that.

164
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,889
But I love Peter Parker more.

165
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:58,670
Thats worth it to me.

166
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:01,248
I cannot lose you too.

167
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:06,122
Because you do not want,
we can't be together?

168
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,822
Why are we here?

169
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:15,078
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

170
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:22,320
You have done this to me...

171
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:26,243
Again, again... Peter

172
00:19:26,987 --> 00:19:29,390
I can't live like that.

173
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:33,740
I break up with you.

174
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:38,134
I broke up with you.

175
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:19,709

177
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:27,450

This is a wind turbine.
Did you make this? No way!!

185
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,779

196
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:29,361
<i>Listen I'm upset.. Spider-Man
to me is being misunderstood.</i>

197

What are you doing?
Did you make a cake?

233
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:53,205
People do not see the little
things that you do for others.

234
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,617
I know what they say about you in the
press, but it doesn't matter to me.

235
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:59,658
Because I know the real you.
Because You're amazing.

236
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:02,590
That's what the press needs.

237
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,718
They should call you the
amazing Spider-Man '.

238

Circuit break

241
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:26,528
I'm not late.
I'll be there in fifteen minutes.

242
00:25:26,553 --> 00:25:30,666
I just wanna know if you can find another
waitress to replace me.

243
00:25:30,691 --> 00:25:33,363
Because I start my training, up at
the hospital.

244
00:25:33,394 --> 00:25:37,945
But don't mention this to Peter.
Because he worries.

245
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,564
Yeh.yeh, Okay you got it. Double
shift on Thursday. Okay bye.

- Who was that?
- Harvey.

247
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:52,716
- A double shift huh?
- Sometimes.

248
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,272
I have nothing else to do
I like the girls.

249
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:58,838
I miss Ben, give me a little
extra, in my cookie jar.

250
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:04,110
I have some, another couple of photos
from the bugle so that outa help.

251
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:07,121
It would really help if that guy
would give me a fair wage

252
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:11,500
Jameson pays me a fair wage,
as it was in 1961.

253
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,834
HEY, HEY, wait. Where you

Its my job, I've been doing your
laundry since you were six years old.

I'm in college now, its time I took
care of my own dirty underwear.

257
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,327
The last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red.

258
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:33,887
That was a mistake.
I was washing the American flag.

259
00:26:34,938 --> 00:26:36,797
No one washes the flag.

260
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:40,806
I do, I wont anymore fine
It's just underwear.

261
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:45,358
This is my laundry, my home
my machine. Eat your breakfast.

262
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:49,903
Alright laundry sheriff.
I'll do it later.

I'll do it. Give it.
No, I'll do it another time.

264

00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:50,711
Looking at my son,
and seeing a stranger.

311
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:55,629
You had such potential, Harry.

312
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:02,259
Such intelligence,
and you've thrown it all away.

313
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:04,750
You threw me away.

314
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:09,682
You sent me to boarding
when I was eleven.

315
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,363
On my 16th birthday...

316
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:17,690
you sent me Scotch.
Or one of your assistants did.

317
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,785
I'm pretty sure, there
was the card: In it.

318
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,834
With compliments. Norman Osborn.

319
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:29,731
I don't. Expect forgiveness
from you

320
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,529
I don't believe in miracles.

321
00:31:33,677 --> 00:31:36,843
How could you possibly
understand...

322
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:40,571
that your childhood
had to be sacrificed...

323
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:43,050
for something greater?

324
00:31:43,258 --> 00:31:47,130
Not just for me. For you.

325
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,361
Are your hands starting to twitch yet?

326
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,285
When you lay awake...

327
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,656
Hiding under your skin...

328
00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:04,746
waiting to show itself.

329
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:09,992
To show you who you really are.

330
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:16,825
Retroviral hyperplasia.

331
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:21,136
I never told you...

332
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:24,390
But its genetic.

333
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:28,393
Our disease.

334
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:31,411
The Osborn curse.

335
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:34,647
When it began at your age.

336
00:32:36,016 --> 00:32:37,872
Let me see it.

337
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:41,939
Your hand, give it to me.

338
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:52,692
The greatest inheritance
I can give you

339
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:56,024
is not money.

340
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:04,352
Told you about my work.

341
00:33:04,391 --> 00:33:07,270
Perhaps you can succeed...

342
00:33:07,305 --> 00:33:09,003
where I failed.

343
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:21,956
BEST MR JAMESON NEW PHOTOS ADDED

WRONG

347

<i>Norman Osborn, the legendary founder
and CEO of Oscorp Industries has died.</i>

348

<i>He is survived by his only son, Harry
Osborn, who is the sole heir...</i>

350
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,170
<i>of the Oscorp corporate empire..</i>

351
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:50,331
<i>Osborn fundamentaly changed the medical

352
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:52,908
<i>And affected the lives of millions
.</i>

353
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:57,302
<i>I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought.</i>

354
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:00,440
<i>"We can do better.
We should do better. ".</i>

355
00:34:00,475 --> 00:34:06,080
<i>Einstein said the world can not be changed,
without changing our thinking.</i>

356
00:34:06,115 --> 00:34:08,930
<i>But change isn't just a slogan.</i>

357
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:14,691
<i>It begins with hard work. Change begins
with persistence and commitment.</i>

358
00:34:14,743 --> 00:34:18,056
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

359
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:22,978
Now its up to each of us to ensure that
his hopes and dreams remain alive.

360
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:24,805
But not today.

361
00:34:24,974 --> 00:34:27,720
- Today...
- Hello?

362
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:30,424
<i>I speaking with Gwen Stacy
Yeah, who's calling?</i>

363
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:34,841
<i>I'm calling from the Oxford college

365
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,946
Theres a current flow problem in genomics
lab.Why don't you go take a Look at that.

366
00:34:44,948 --> 00:34:47,949
It's my birthday. Everybody else

367
00:34:47,977 --> 00:34:51,832
Because you're special. Smythe...

368
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:53,611

<i>Production of electricity by

371
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:07,180
Hi guys.

372
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:10,201
Someone loves a party.

373
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:13,031
You're just a little queasy.

374
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,059
I got your medicine.

375
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:22,321
And on my birthday.
After all I've done for this company.

376
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:25,125
<i>Warning.</i>

377
00:35:25,295 --> 00:35:28,498
<i>Error in sector 5A
It's just reflux...</i>

378
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:33,050
Did you know my birthday, Kari? Get
you to sing "Happy Birthday" for me?

379
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:35,232
Then I'll just have to sing
it to myself.

380
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:40,428
Gilbert, its Max. Can you shut
down power in sector 32, please?

381

<i>Sorry, Max</i>

383
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:51,695
I'll do it myself.
And I'll sing to myself.

384
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:59,492
Happy Birthday... To me.

385
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:12,929
Happy Birthday.

386
00:36:14,531 --> 00:36:15,031

<i>System restored Have a nice day.</i>

388
00:36:54,590 --> 00:37:01,666
Harry, Oscorps are under intense public scrutiny,
in the wake of Dr. Connors recent breach of trust.

389
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:06,788
You mean, people are pisssed off because he
tried to turn everyone into giant lizards?

390
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:10,144
Given that...

391
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:14,013
all the animals hybrids programs he
was involved in were destroyed...

392
00:37:14,448 --> 00:37:17,423
to restore investor confidence.

393
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:20,898
That is, the Osborn way.

394
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:24,709
If somethings inconvenient round
here just get rid of it, right?

395
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:28,311
Much of that statemen may fall on
you now.

396
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:32,024
You sell a plausible deniability as
your best option... Sure, sure.

397
00:37:33,614 --> 00:37:38,055
A twenty-year-old kid.
A 200 billion dollar company.

398
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,168
What was Dad thinking?

399
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:43,552
I mean You're all lawyers...
Right!

400
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:48,148
Surely someone must have questioned his
sanity in the end.

401
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:51,870
Someone must have thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

402
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,879
It would have made this conversation,
a lot easier... Harry...

403
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,211
It's Mr. Osborn.

404
00:37:58,217 --> 00:37:59,936
We're not friends.

405
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:07,387
Hii.

406
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,948
You were his assistant, right?

407
00:38:17,335 --> 00:38:20,900
What is your name?
Felicia... Felicia.

408
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:28,128
From now on, everybody at this table
will? Felicia.

409
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:31,983
Because Felicia works for me.

410
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:35,643
Would anybody like to speak up??

411
00:38:37,376 --> 00:38:41,320
Well good. Then you can all
keep your jobs, for a while.

412
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:45,681
Sir... There's Peter Parker
that you would like to speak to you

413
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:56,753
Felicia, I want to see every
file on this list.

414
00:38:58,082 --> 00:38:59,676
Every single one.

415
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:12,200
Peter Parker.
It's like seeing a ghost.

416
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,649
Hi, Harry.

417
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:16,876
So random.

418
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,336
- Its ten years.
- Eight.

419
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,538
Close.

420
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:26,879
So, how you doing kid.

421
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,049
I heard about your Dad and I wanted
to... Come and..

422
00:39:30,265 --> 00:39:34,504
To check it out, To see how you're doing.

423
00:39:34,864 --> 00:39:36,668
I'm with some people.

424
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,344
I'm in a meeting.

425
00:39:43,665 --> 00:39:47,402
Sorry I didn't want to intrude,
I know it's been a long time.

426
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:50,287
I know exactly what you're going through.
.

427
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:53,445
And you were so there for me when my
parents...

428
00:39:53,616 --> 00:39:56,212
Thats why I'm here.

429
00:39:56,884 --> 00:39:58,515
Thank you.

430
00:40:00,736 --> 00:40:03,197
It was good to see you man.

431
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,476
Very good.

432
00:40:07,206 --> 00:40:09,009
Sorry about your Dad.

433
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,127
You've got your braces on.

434
00:40:18,189 --> 00:40:21,978
Now it is all your focus back on your
one eyebrow.

435
00:40:25,064 --> 00:40:26,449
There it is.

436
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:29,106
There it is.

437
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,124
Does someone dry your
hair every morning?

438
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,193
One of my main servants
hold the hair dryer...

439
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,493
But I work the comb.

440
00:40:38,718 --> 00:40:43,536
Okay, so at least I'm not completely
helpless.

441
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:54,605
After graduation I went
to Brazil and Singapore.

442
00:40:55,457 --> 00:40:58,541
- And then Europe.
- I saw you.

443
00:41:00,154 --> 00:41:01,664
What do you mean? You saw.

444
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,718
I saw you in some magazine with some French
supermodel, You know what I'm talking about?

445
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:12,538
The whole model thing is
so exhausting. I know.

446
00:41:14,028 --> 00:41:15,691
What?

447
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:18,071
Do you have a girl?

448
00:41:22,328 --> 00:41:24,524
Thats a question.

449
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:26,788
Thats a question.

450
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,236
No, I'm not a girl.

451
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:34,988
I don't know.

452
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,500
It's complicated.

453
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:43,761
Yeh I don't do complicated.

454
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:47,861
So What's her name? Who is she?

455
00:41:47,927 --> 00:41:51,167
Her name is Gwen. Gwen Stacy.

456
00:41:51,622 --> 00:41:54,908
- Gwen Stacy?
- She works for you.

457
00:41:55,061 --> 00:41:56,779
Really?

458
00:41:56,814 --> 00:42:00,428
She's an intern Oscorp.
Is she a model employee?

459
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:07,347
When my father sent away me I tried to
forget everything about this place..

460
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:11,059
I guess that kind of
includes you.

461
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:17,470
You don't have to explain to me.
Bro.

462
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,694
We both got dumped.

463
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:26,297
Did you ever figure out why your parents
bailed?

464
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:32,015
My Dad left a briefcase.

465
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,886
Thats all I got a briefcase full of junk.

466
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:39,536
I try not to think about it.
Hows that working out for you?

467
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:41,594
Perfect.

468
00:42:47,368 --> 00:42:50,513
What a throw.

469
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:52,549
Its just the wrist.Its just all in the
wrist buddy.

470
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:56,383
<i>You can do it with some strength.</i>

471
00:42:56,971 --> 00:43:00,790
Things have gottne crazy around here man.

472
00:43:01,427 --> 00:43:03,338
<i>Giant lizards, and...</i>

473
00:43:03,573 --> 00:43:05,890
Spider-Guy.

474
00:43:07,843 --> 00:43:10,652
There's just one guy,
just one Spider-Man.

475
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:14,597
Or woman.
We don't know for sure.

476
00:43:15,035 --> 00:43:18,533
He ​wears spandex to rescues kittens from
trees.

477
00:43:19,414 --> 00:43:21,506
Very impressive.

478
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:25,414
I think he just gives people hope.
For what?

479
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:28,468
That eventually everything gonna
be alright.

480
00:43:28,504 --> 00:43:31,528
I wish I had time for eventually.

481
00:43:34,886 --> 00:43:39,616
Who was he? Maxwell Dillon,
electrical engineer.

482
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:42,592
No associates or friends to speak of.

483
00:43:42,628 --> 00:43:46,186
He ​​submitted specs for the grid,
that we... appropriated.

484
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:49,440
He was invisible.

485
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:54,444
Wall Street's nervous enough that
child having taken over the company.

486
00:43:54,479 --> 00:43:56,787
We've got to find a way to get him out.

487
00:43:56,822 --> 00:44:01,466
In the meantime the press gets hold of this
accident. Our stock will?

488
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:05,735
So make sure that this Mr. Dillon
still remains invisible.

489
00:44:06,886 --> 00:44:10,249
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

490
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,501
Hi.

491
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,482
Move.

492
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:00,524
Hey!

493
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:08,425
You look amazing.

494
00:46:09,368 --> 00:46:12,523
I'm sorry for the spontaneous...

495
00:46:12,558 --> 00:46:15,264
Spontaneous is...

496
00:46:16,936 --> 00:46:21,644
Its how I feel.
I just figured it was time.

497
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:25,691
Time we try to be friends.

498
00:46:29,657 --> 00:46:32,473
Friends, yeah, that's...

499
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:34,794
awesome.

500
00:46:34,828 --> 00:46:37,087
I don't want this to be complicated.

501
00:46:37,122 --> 00:46:41,331
I hate complicated.
Keep it simple.

502
00:46:42,235 --> 00:46:47,421
Okay great. Yeh, yeh. But...
I mean.

503
00:46:48,777 --> 00:46:54,060
Look If we're friends,
we gotta establish some ground rules.

504
00:46:54,095 --> 00:46:56,073
Basic Rules?

505
00:46:56,616 --> 00:46:59,444
- Like that.
- Like what?

506
00:47:00,642 --> 00:47:03,218
That laugh.

507
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,001
This should not.

508
00:47:05,036 --> 00:47:09,298
You must annoying laugh.

509
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:13,220
That's still adorable.

510
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:17,085
That was not adorable.

511
00:47:17,707 --> 00:47:21,901
Okay I've got one.
What? What is it.

512
00:47:22,445 --> 00:47:25,243
Don't tell me that I look amazing..

513
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:29,594
With your big brown doe eyes.

514
00:47:30,444 --> 00:47:32,589
I really mean it.

515
00:47:33,553 --> 00:47:35,485
No..No... What

516
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:38,963
I've just figured out the next
ground rule.

517
00:47:39,088 --> 00:47:40,726
Do more of this.

518
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:44,791
The nose rub.

519
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,285
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

520
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,400
I can not stand. I'm gone.

521
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:54,031
Come on.

522
00:47:55,232 --> 00:47:57,703
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

523
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:38,290
I have done it.

524
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:43,883
And as I completely addicted to this
place that has Korean meatballs.

525
00:48:43,944 --> 00:48:46,243
Are you going to eat?
It's great.

526
00:48:46,268 --> 00:48:48,845
On 6th Street. I know
You will love it there.

527
00:48:51,197 --> 00:48:52,707
How do you know?

528
00:48:55,685 --> 00:48:57,488
How do you know I love it there?

529
00:48:58,438 --> 00:48:59,538
Cos hmm.

530
00:49:02,032 --> 00:49:03,707
You told me.

531
00:49:06,872 --> 00:49:08,885
It just opened last month.

532
00:49:12,561 --> 00:49:14,980
Did you follow me?

533
00:49:19,953 --> 00:49:23,056
I knew it. How often?

534
00:49:26,826 --> 00:49:29,806
Just once a day. Sometimes.

535
00:49:32,112 --> 00:49:33,830
Sometimes more.

536
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,175
Why?

537
00:49:46,154 --> 00:49:49,291
To watch me? ...Yeh.

538
00:49:50,598 --> 00:49:54,575
And because its the closest
I could get to you.

539
00:50:06,654 --> 00:50:08,876
I'm moving to England.

540
00:50:17,198 --> 00:50:19,422
What?...Yeh.

541
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:25,134
I have a scholarship at Oxford.

542
00:50:25,296 --> 00:50:27,034
In molecular medicine.

543
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:30,835
It's between me and this other kid.and
there's this oral exam... We need to do

544
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,841
and he's like a freshman
in college, but he's 14 years.

545
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:38,727
He can possibly be,
but I can be.

546
00:50:38,763 --> 00:50:42,180
And then I have to move to England.

547
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:46,516
I'm really excited.

548
00:50:47,985 --> 00:50:49,935
That's...

549
00:50:52,518 --> 00:50:54,240
England?

550
00:51:53,825 --> 00:51:56,131
I need reinforcements.

551
00:51:56,296 --> 00:51:59,815
Send patrol cars to the southend
corner of Duffy Square.

552
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,597
Everyone get out the way please.
Get out the way.

553
00:52:05,443 --> 00:52:09,070
Remove your hands from the cables.

554
00:52:09,104 --> 00:52:11,599
Get your hands away
from the cables.

555
00:52:11,634 --> 00:52:13,913
Let me see your hands.

556
00:52:15,894 --> 00:52:18,564
Stay right where you are.
Do not move.

557
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,998
Freeze. Get down, on the ground.

558
00:52:38,745 --> 00:52:40,565
Get down on the ground now.

559
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:43,555
- Stop.
- On the floor.

560
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:46,415
It's not my fault. Stop.

561
00:52:46,987 --> 00:52:49,098
Please...

562
00:52:54,193 --> 00:52:55,964
My goodness.

563
00:52:57,016 --> 00:52:59,802
They see me standing. They see me.

564
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:05,083
They see me.

565
00:53:17,298 --> 00:53:20,047
No... Stop. Don't do that.

566
00:53:20,082 --> 00:53:21,735
Please.

567
00:53:21,848 --> 00:53:24,264
Wait, it's not my fault.

568
00:53:24,399 --> 00:53:26,517
It's not my fault.

569
00:53:29,286 --> 00:53:31,515
I said, stop.

570
00:53:37,161 --> 00:53:39,924
I'm glad your not one of those
cops that rides a horse.

571
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,220
Team members... Hold your fire and wait for
my call.

572
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,716
Hold your fire, I repeat hold
your fire. And stay down.

573
00:53:57,551 --> 00:54:01,219
Stop. Stop it well, Sparkle.

574
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,610
Hey..How are you doing?

575
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:08,961
It's You. Well I know its me,
Who are you?

576
00:54:09,556 --> 00:54:13,975
You don't remember me?
No, should I?

577
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,208
I walked into the street, the car
almost hit me. You swung me up.

578
00:54:18,244 --> 00:54:22,003
You saved me.
You said you needed me.

579
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:26,178
The guy, you're the guy with the
Blue-prints... Yes, Blue-prints

580
00:54:26,212 --> 00:54:30,937

you, your my eyes and ears.

581
00:54:31,106 --> 00:54:34,000
What's your name again?
How could you forget me?

582
00:54:34,165 --> 00:54:37,770
I do, I know. I know it, don't tell me...
It's Max. Is it Max?

583
00:54:37,805 --> 00:54:39,146

How are you?

586
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:49,591
I don't know what's going on
with me... I believe you.

587
00:54:49,971 --> 00:54:54,939
Its strange.
I have so much strength.

588
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:57,130
I have so much anger.

589
00:54:57,164 --> 00:55:00,375
I can see that, you don't want
to be here You're scared.

590
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:03,883
You don't know whats happening, to you, I can
see that you don't want to hurt anybody.

591
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:06,890
You'll be alright. I've got a clear shot.
Standing by.

592
00:55:06,925 --> 00:55:08,847
They're not going to shooy you.

593
00:55:08,883 --> 00:55:10,850
Guys, this is my buddy Max.

594
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:15,343
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max.

595
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:18,559
It's just between you and me talkin. Whoahh...
Stay right there, stay right there.

596
00:55:18,584 --> 00:55:21,687
Be careful with the grid
and the electricity.

597
00:55:23,467 --> 00:55:25,440
I just wanted them to all see me.

598
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:27,923
<i>If he makes a move,
take that shot.</i>

599
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:32,303
Come with me, somewhere we'll talk
away from all these people... Okay.

600
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,572
NO... Stop.

601
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:02,312
Spidey.

602
00:56:04,374 --> 00:56:06,447
You..Queer.

603
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:14,640
Electric idiot.

604
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:21,640
<i>He lied to me, he shot me...</i>

605
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,404
Shut up.

606
00:56:27,129 --> 00:56:29,347
You're so selfish.

607
00:56:29,372 --> 00:56:31,259
Stay with me Max.

608
00:56:31,294 --> 00:56:34,016
You set me up.
No..I didn't set you up.

609
00:56:34,551 --> 00:56:38,163
You lied to me. No, I'm trying
to help you, let me help you.

610
00:57:32,807 --> 00:57:34,837
It's my birthday.

611
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:38,503
And now Its time for me to light up
candles.

612
00:58:55,317 --> 00:58:57,559
Can anyone see Spider-Man?

613
00:58:58,453 --> 00:59:01,315
Can anyone see Spider-Man?

614
00:59:11,153 --> 00:59:13,770
That's enough.

615
00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:17,627
Mike. Big John.

616
00:59:17,664 --> 00:59:22,272
Nice work fella's. It was a
pleasure doing business with you.

617
00:59:29,378 --> 00:59:31,961
Spider-Man...

618
00:59:37,891 --> 00:59:39,657
England?

619
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,494
Really?

620
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:53,771
That's hot.

621
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:16,203
Our coverage of a breaking story begins
with Jessica Abo, at the scene.

622
01:00:16,228 --> 01:00:20,214
We're staying here with two eyewitnesses,
who are going to tell what they just saw.

623
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:23,846
So tell us How did the Spider-Man
do it. How did he beat this creature.

624
01:00:24,071 --> 01:00:27,974
Its got to be rubberised, Spideys suit
thats why he didn't get electrocuted.

625
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,648
Probably neoprene.

626
01:00:30,983 --> 01:00:35,346
Thank you very much, the two of you
so many questions remain unanswered..

627
01:01:31,368 --> 01:01:33,332
WHAT IS ROOSEVELT?

628
01:02:18,228 --> 01:02:19,987
DO I HAVE TO LOSE YOU TOO????

629
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:33,543
Online polls show a sudden upset of public
sentiment in favourof the wall-crawler.

630
01:02:33,612 --> 01:02:37,411
Tonight it would seem the city owes him
a debt of gratitude.

631
01:03:09,033 --> 01:03:11,331
Next generation of
military body armor.

632
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:15,420
Features include enhanced
mobility, battlefield injury repair.

633
01:03:15,488 --> 01:03:17,879
Nervous system interface.

634
01:03:26,712 --> 01:03:30,451
So the common household spider,
and merged human cells.

635
01:03:30,959 --> 01:03:33,801
Have contained the power
to self heal...

636
01:03:34,169 --> 01:03:36,914
From severe infection, tissue damage.

637
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:41,431
We used a radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA..

638
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:47,463
Welcome to, Dr. Jallings science
investigator.

639
01:03:47,488 --> 01:03:50,268
Today we're going to be talking about
electricity. Very interesting.

640
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,182
Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic current.

641
01:03:53,607 --> 01:03:56,268
Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming current.

642
01:03:56,293 --> 01:03:59,449
The more powerful the battery, the
bigger the current it can withstand.

643
01:04:00,065 --> 01:04:04,179
If the incoming charge,
exeeds the outgoing charge.

644
01:04:04,236 --> 01:04:08,742
The battery might explode.
EXPLODE.!!!

645
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:14,611
Doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.

646
01:04:15,278 --> 01:04:17,450
We need a bigger power.

647
01:04:58,407 --> 01:05:01,675
Hello? Pete its me.

648
01:05:02,613 --> 01:05:07,041
Hello, Harry. What time is it?

649
01:05:07,435 --> 01:05:11,122
Late. I dunno.
I've been up all night.

650
01:05:11,585 --> 01:05:14,349
I need to see you.
You alright...?

651
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:16,238
Not really Pete.

652
01:05:16,406 --> 01:05:20,640
I'm dying... But I think you can help
save my life.

653
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:26,686
Your looking at the world's first
Human-Spider hybrid.

654
01:05:26,794 --> 01:05:29,931
In the hope is to extract the venom
from their glands.

655
01:05:30,056 --> 01:05:35,289
Turn that into a cure, an agent
That heals diseased cells.

656
01:05:35,317 --> 01:05:37,712
And If I can be cured...

657
01:05:37,924 --> 01:05:42,935
Imagine what this could do for other
diseases like Alzheimer's even cancer..

658
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:49,259
They never made it to
human trials.

659
01:05:49,697 --> 01:05:53,344
14 years of research, and nothing
to show for it.

660
01:05:56,354 --> 01:05:58,535
Except maybe this.

661
01:06:05,746 --> 01:06:09,715
- Spider-Man.
- What about him?

662
01:06:10,313 --> 01:06:13,331
He was bitten by one of
those things and it worked.

663
01:06:13,912 --> 01:06:17,598
I don't know how and I
don't know why... But

664
01:06:18,263 --> 01:06:24,171
he can do everything else a spider can..
Including Self heal.

665
01:06:24,612 --> 01:06:26,463
I need to find him.

666
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,695
I need his blood.

667
01:06:43,554 --> 01:06:48,517
You drink Spider-Man's blood?

668
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:56,761
It will save my life.
It may not Harry.

669
01:06:56,995 --> 01:06:59,031
It's not that simple.

670
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:02,652
Look what happened to Curt Connors.
Connors was weak.

671
01:07:02,577 --> 01:07:04,505
This is me Peter.

672
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:09,787
Why do not you put it in the newspaper,
help him donate?

673
01:07:09,944 --> 01:07:14,456
I'm sure he's sensitive to people shoving
needles...

674
01:07:14,935 --> 01:07:16,498
Sensitive?

675
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:21,461
Well then you could just sensitive me,
tell me where he is.

676
01:07:21,524 --> 01:07:24,879
And I will go ask him myself...
No.

677
01:07:28,051 --> 01:07:32,325
You took his picture.
So you know him.

678
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:38,021
I took a picture from a long way away,
it was a long lens. I don't know him.

679
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:42,742
Together you said at the river.

680
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,859
How he gives people hope.

681
01:07:48,595 --> 01:07:50,458
Come on.

682
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:55,468
DATABASE BY START SEARCH

683
01:07:57,525 --> 01:08:00,419
SEARCH USER

684
01:08:01,033 --> 01:08:02,626
NAME NOT FOUND

685
01:08:05,883 --> 01:08:07,477
SEARCH BLOCKED

686
01:08:09,382 --> 01:08:11,718
Just say yes.

687
01:08:17,856 --> 01:08:20,348
Don't turn your back on me.

688
01:08:21,146 --> 01:08:24,662
I do not want to end up like my father.
Peter.

689
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:27,678
Please.

690
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:31,136
Peter, please.

691
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,906
I will try and find Spider-Man.

692
01:08:56,101 --> 01:08:59,036
What does the security here?

693
01:09:07,641 --> 01:09:10,116
Wait. Miss Stacy.

694
01:09:28,516 --> 01:09:31,813
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

695
01:09:41,851 --> 01:09:44,656
She's not here.
Look on another floor.

696
01:09:45,622 --> 01:09:48,089
You in trouble?? Who's that man?

697
01:09:48,113 --> 01:09:51,241
There was an accident,
they are trying to cover it up.

698
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:54,719
When I found out, that guy
from Times Square Last week...

699
01:09:55,056 --> 01:09:58,240
I met him, he was and an
electrical engineer..

700
01:09:58,309 --> 01:10:01,171
He would Spider-Man love it.

701
01:10:00,995 --> 01:10:05,213
Because I got the feeling,
that he wanted to kill me.

702
01:10:04,929 --> 01:10:07,585
How it feels to love you.

703
01:10:08,106 --> 01:10:11,337
I visited him in the computer,
but everything was cleared about him.

704
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:14,188
Totally glossed over.
Typically Oscorp.

705
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:19,388
Why are you here?
Harry, he's dying.

706
01:10:19,931 --> 01:10:21,625
- What do you mean?
- He's dying.

707
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:26,850
And He thinks Spider-Man's blood can save
his life. My blood and Spider-mans blood.

708
01:10:26,975 --> 01:10:29,575
As far as I know, if I give it to
him, it could kill him.

709
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,447
Or worse.

710
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,071
This is a maintenance closet.
Gwen!

711
01:10:36,658 --> 01:10:39,593
The most? Hiding place
you could have chosen.

712
01:10:39,863 --> 01:10:41,513
I'm... sorry.

713
01:10:41,525 --> 01:10:46,053
This hiding place could
take us to the Bahamas.

714
01:10:46,178 --> 01:10:50,034
We need to talk about England,
because I do not want...

715
01:10:59,802 --> 01:11:02,906
You kissed me. I'm sorry,
I couldn't help it.

716
01:11:03,448 --> 01:11:05,039
How did you like it?

717
01:11:05,521 --> 01:11:09,297
- It felt a bit rushed.
- I know.

718
01:11:09,378 --> 01:11:12,860
This is the plan. Get the elevator,
while I distract him.

719
01:11:45,263 --> 01:11:47,440
I'm sorry... I'm all thumbs today

720
01:11:52,313 --> 01:11:54,293
Gwen Stacy

721
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:02,768
I'm Harry... Yeh

722
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:07,420
I'm an old friend of Peters.
Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

723
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,333
I was funny rushing...

724
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:14,326
I'm sorry he never mentioned.
I thought you two had broken up.

725
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:20,513
Yeh, yeh, we have but it's...

726
01:12:20,717 --> 01:12:22,645
Complicated.

727
01:12:23,012 --> 01:12:27,878
Everythings always
complicated with Peter.

728
01:12:30,016 --> 01:12:34,142
That's right. But
that's why he needs you.

729
01:12:35,467 --> 01:12:37,024
Right?

730
01:12:38,903 --> 01:12:42,079
To help him make his choices
clear.

731
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:49,896
Nice meeting you. Yeh
It was a pleasure.

732
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:05,277
RAVENSCROFT INSTITUTE

733
01:13:45,526 --> 01:13:48,629
You've had a terrible accident.

734
01:13:50,629 --> 01:13:55,214
I'm Dr. Kafka.
I'm here to help you.

735
01:13:55,576 --> 01:13:57,379
Of course, Doctor.

736
01:13:58,176 --> 01:14:02,326
Thats why you prepared
military grade, Biostim electrodes.

737
01:14:02,898 --> 01:14:07,651
High intensity capacitors.
The kind they make at Oscorp.

738
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:10,625
All this because you're trying to help me.

739
01:14:10,694 --> 01:14:12,272
You are correct.

740
01:14:12,288 --> 01:14:14,300
I'm here to study you.

741
01:14:14,469 --> 01:14:19,206
To understand what you are, and why
.

742
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:21,761
I will get results.

743
01:14:26,878 --> 01:14:28,973
I always do.

744
01:14:31,028 --> 01:14:35,499
Do you realize you'll lock me in a
prison...

745
01:14:35,765 --> 01:14:39,524
powered by electricity?

746
01:14:41,763 --> 01:14:46,291
I feel it in the walls.
In my veins.

747
01:14:47,337 --> 01:14:50,896
What you do. You can't contain.

748
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:55,315
It's a force of nature. Like me.

749
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:04,893
Want to know how powerful I am?
Yes.

750
01:15:04,993 --> 01:15:07,464
Well so do I..

751
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:10,751
GOOD, ,,GOOD

752
01:15:11,293 --> 01:15:15,152
I'm dying to know.

753
01:15:15,223 --> 01:15:20,836
You'd better make damn sure that you
kill me. Because if you don't..

754
01:15:21,461 --> 01:15:23,513
I'm gonnna kill the light.

755
01:15:23,531 --> 01:15:28,252
Everyone in this city, will discover
how it feels, to live in my world.

756
01:15:29,143 --> 01:15:34,186
A world without power.
A world without mercy.

757
01:15:34,255 --> 01:15:37,793
A world without Spider-Man.

758
01:15:37,818 --> 01:15:42,097
And everyone will see me
who or what.

759
01:15:42,683 --> 01:15:44,696
Who are you?

760
01:15:45,526 --> 01:15:49,264
Don't you know? I am Electro.

761
01:15:54,127 --> 01:15:57,626
<i>Warning . Electrical capacity reaches
escape.</i>

762
01:15:57,662 --> 01:16:00,511
Initiate lockdown
procedure, immmediately.

763
01:16:01,136 --> 01:16:05,693
Very impressive, Electro.

764
01:16:06,141 --> 01:16:08,431
Lockdown began.

765
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:22,570
Aunt May?

766
01:16:27,008 --> 01:16:30,723
What are you doing?
When did you do this?

767
01:16:39,794 --> 01:16:42,435
There's something your not
telling me, Aunt May.

768
01:16:42,804 --> 01:16:45,907
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

769
01:16:46,391 --> 01:16:49,434
I know you're not telling me something.
You're lying to me.

770
01:16:49,459 --> 01:16:53,001
I know you love me... I don't. I
know you love me..But you do.

771
01:16:54,006 --> 01:16:58,124
Tell me. It's my father.

772
01:16:58,285 --> 01:16:59,911
Yes, he was your father...

773
01:17:00,219 --> 01:17:04,772
but that didn't seem to stop him
from leaving you.

774
01:17:06,066 --> 01:17:08,230
I need the truth.

775
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:12,776
The truth is that your parents left you
here, on our door-step.

776
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:17,344
This little boy whose world was turned
upside down with no explanation.

777
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:20,828
We did the best, we could.

778
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:22,743
You Uncle Ben, he and I.

779
01:17:22,918 --> 01:17:26,475
Who else was going to care for you and
protect you? And worries about you.

780
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,910
Your father? No.

781
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:33,712
I was the one who wiped your nose,
who made you brush your teeth...

782
01:17:33,737 --> 01:17:36,463
and do your homework. And washed
your dirty underwear. ME!!

783
01:17:36,488 --> 01:17:41,638
You stupid, nonscientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet...

784
01:17:41,663 --> 01:17:46,625
who has to take nursing classes, with 22 year old
kids, so I can pay for you to go to college.

785
01:17:46,694 --> 01:17:50,256
And I don't know how to do
this without Ben. I don't know how.

786
01:17:51,053 --> 01:17:54,280
And you're dreaming about your perfect
father...

787
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:57,174
Who was never here. NO!

788
01:17:58,346 --> 01:18:01,469
No I wont tell you.
You're my boy.

789
01:18:01,794 --> 01:18:06,731
As far as I'm concerned, you're my boy.
And I wont hurt you

790
01:18:15,168 --> 01:18:18,839
I'm your boy.
You're my everything.

791
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:26,259
You're more than enough.
That's not what this is about.

792
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:30,620
- I love you so much.
- I know.

793
01:18:35,124 --> 01:18:39,584
It's okay.

794
01:18:41,521 --> 01:18:43,099
Aunt May...

795
01:18:46,006 --> 01:18:48,187
I need to know.

796
01:18:52,845 --> 01:18:54,419
Alright.

797
01:18:57,674 --> 01:18:59,896
I'll tell you everything I know.

798
01:19:02,602 --> 01:19:05,552
But It will hurt you. Okay.

799
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:11,901
A few days after the funeral...

800
01:19:12,031 --> 01:19:15,807
The government men.
Came to see us.

801
01:19:17,756 --> 01:19:20,690
They said, the genetic research...

802
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:24,379
That your father was doing with
Norman Osborn, was very valuable.

803
01:19:24,705 --> 01:19:29,483
And that people would pay a lot for it.
And thats why he ran off with it.

804
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:33,445
They said he was a traitor.
I couldn't believe it.

805
01:19:33,934 --> 01:19:38,494
They told us he betrayed his best
friend for, all of us, for the money.

806
01:19:43,204 --> 01:19:45,449
I don't understand..

807
01:19:45,474 --> 01:19:49,205
Yes, I know.
I didn't believe it.

808
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,648
This doesn't make any sense..
Peter... I don't know how.

809
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:59,032
For so long. I would play it over and over in
my head, what had I missed. What had I missed.

810
01:19:59,057 --> 01:20:05,019
He was just a normal unasuming guy. He wore
the same ratty lab coat for 20 years...

811
01:20:05,244 --> 01:20:08,014
He took the D train to work,
at seven every morning...

812
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:10,361
came home at 6 every night.

813
01:20:11,331 --> 01:20:12,841
I don't know.

814
01:20:13,337 --> 01:20:16,605
Maybe everyone has a part of
themself, to hide...

815
01:20:17,513 --> 01:20:19,977
Even from the people they love.

816
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,332
Mr. Osborn.

817
01:20:42,122 --> 01:20:46,515
Look up.
You were looking for me.

818
01:20:48,831 --> 01:20:51,052
I do not believe my eyes.

819
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:53,290
Spider-Man.

820
01:21:00,609 --> 01:21:03,366
Just the man I wanted to see.

821
01:21:05,471 --> 01:21:10,689
You ah, talked to Peter? ...Yep

822
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:21,027
I want to help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

823
01:21:22,114 --> 01:21:25,849
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

824
01:21:25,974 --> 01:21:29,874
- Pardon?
- It's too dangerous.

825
01:21:30,587 --> 01:21:34,249
If our blood is not compatible,
you could die.

826
01:21:34,652 --> 01:21:36,455
I'm already dying.

827
01:21:37,295 --> 01:21:42,040
Your blood can give me time.
But it could do something worse.

828
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:45,219
Okay.

829
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:48,800
Alright How much?

830
01:21:49,325 --> 01:21:51,112
- What?
- How much do you want?

831
01:21:51,137 --> 01:21:55,829
A boat or plane? Or
Money? How much do you want?

832
01:21:56,455 --> 01:21:59,767
I don't want your money.
Everybody wants my money

833
01:22:00,765 --> 01:22:02,540
I don't.

834
01:22:05,864 --> 01:22:08,254
I thought you saved people.

835
01:22:08,927 --> 01:22:12,618
I thought thats what you do.
Is you save peoples lives.

836
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:15,692
You just gonna let me die.

837
01:22:15,717 --> 01:22:18,985
I'm trying to protect you.
Right now.

838
01:22:19,665 --> 01:22:22,181
You're trying to protect yourself.

839
01:22:22,224 --> 01:22:26,920
Look..We just need
a bit more time...

840
01:22:27,145 --> 01:22:29,762
I have no time. Get out

841
01:22:36,654 --> 01:22:38,289
I'm sorry.

842
01:22:46,632 --> 01:22:49,038
You're a fraud, Spider-Man.

843
01:23:05,451 --> 01:23:08,470
Can I to talk to you for a second.
I'm running late. Right now.

844
01:23:09,085 --> 01:23:11,769
It only takes a minute.

845
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,477
Give me some time.
One thing. Then I'm gone.

846
01:23:15,502 --> 01:23:16,552
It's a mess.

847
01:23:16,577 --> 01:23:19,261
My Dad my mum,
everything my father done lies.

848
01:23:20,118 --> 01:23:22,759
Lies. Lies, lies
Nothings as it seems.

849
01:23:22,911 --> 01:23:26,434
So here we are? I went to see Harry Of
course I want to save him. You know.

850
01:23:26,951 --> 01:23:28,767
He's my best pal.

851
01:23:29,155 --> 01:23:33,901
What if my blood works? But what if it
doesn't? I don't know. I got no idea

852
01:23:36,506 --> 01:23:38,305
I have nothing.

853
01:23:38,365 --> 01:23:41,343
The only thing I keep coming back to...
Gwen Is.

854
01:23:41,906 --> 01:23:45,515
Miss Stacy, shall I take you
upstairs?

855
01:23:45,561 --> 01:23:47,912
Yes, I'm so sorry.

856
01:23:48,063 --> 01:23:52,591
I'm so sorry..I'm already late...
Can I have just one moment?

857
01:23:53,891 --> 01:23:55,750
Thank-you.

858
01:23:56,888 --> 01:24:02,897
Where are we?
This is my last interview for Oxford.

859
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:07,099
I don't know.

860
01:24:09,568 --> 01:24:13,006
I'm sorry to bother you.

861
01:24:13,893 --> 01:24:17,599
But who am I? I am John Hopkins.

862
01:24:17,424 --> 01:24:22,346
I'm one of the young professors at Harvard,
and I'm trying to get her to be in my...

863
01:24:23,218 --> 01:24:25,949
Part of my team. For a while now.

864
01:24:26,018 --> 01:24:29,455
And she is the best person I know,
and a scientific genius.

865
01:24:30,135 --> 01:24:34,782
Anyway, "God save the Queen, ' I'm
sorry that I made things... Peter!!"

866
01:24:35,155 --> 01:24:39,656
Peter What do you want to say to me?
Whats the one thing?

867
01:24:43,921 --> 01:24:45,763
I have to leave for a year.

868
01:24:47,777 --> 01:24:49,403
Its important to me.

869
01:24:53,564 --> 01:24:57,251
Maybe we are moving in
the opposite direction.

870
01:24:57,883 --> 01:24:59,494
I don't know.

871
01:24:59,519 --> 01:25:06,663
We were just going different ways.
I gotta go. I gotta go

872
01:25:09,266 --> 01:25:09,766
Gwen.

873
01:25:12,581 --> 01:25:14,409
Good luck.

874
01:26:34,876 --> 01:26:39,771
'Secret Roosevelt station.
Track 61 secret underground detour...

875
01:26:40,137 --> 01:26:42,906
line D towards Pershing Square.

876
01:26:42,957 --> 01:26:46,688
Here President Franklin Roosevelt
could be transported quickly...

877
01:26:46,713 --> 01:26:50,190
"to keep his polio secret
for the American people."

878
01:26:59,667 --> 01:27:00,279
Mr Osborn.

879
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,779
You alright? Is there anything I can
get you?

880
01:27:06,904 --> 01:27:10,265
No, unless you can bring
those Spiders back, to life.

881
01:27:10,676 --> 01:27:13,903
Spiders?
The ones that they destroyed.

882
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:18,266
"To restore investors confidence."

883
01:27:19,732 --> 01:27:23,552
Go home, Felicia.
Take the day off.

884
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:25,708
Harry!

885
01:27:28,623 --> 01:27:32,439
I think there may be another way,
to get what you're looking for...

886
01:27:34,741 --> 01:27:39,059
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security.

887
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:45,321
Before they destroyed the spiders
they had the venom extracted.

888
01:27:49,803 --> 01:27:51,336
What are you saying?

889
01:27:51,404 --> 01:27:57,300
That way they could comply with the lawsuits, and
still keep the data for when it became useful.

890
01:27:58,725 --> 01:28:01,908
Where is it?
Somewhere in the building.

891
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:06,384
An unregistered department
called "Special Projects".

892

900
01:28:57,562 --> 01:29:01,010
What did you do? A more relevant
question is what did you do?

901
01:29:01,686 --> 01:29:05,089
An employee is killed, and in your
first act as CEO you cover it up.

902
01:29:05,157 --> 01:29:09,987
No, you covered it up, and then you
buried him in the madhouse using my name.

903
01:29:10,156 --> 01:29:13,769
Ravenscroft is a time institution
devoted to mental improvement.

904
01:29:14,321 --> 01:29:19,256
You are experimenting on people in there.
Progress has its stepping stones.

905
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:22,887
Now in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you'll be happy.

How do I say this gently...
sacked.

907
01:29:26,151 --> 01:29:28,026
You are not going to bury me.

908
01:29:28,254 --> 01:29:31,323
It looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

909
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:37,125
It's only a matter of time.
You're going to die a horrible death.

910
01:29:37,282 --> 01:29:39,362
Like your father.

911
01:29:39,921 --> 01:29:44,380
The difference is,
no one is going to miss you.

912
01:29:45,925 --> 01:29:48,385
- Get him out of here.
- Wait.

913
01:29:56,133 --> 01:29:58,254
I know the way out.

914
01:32:42,797 --> 01:32:45,196
My name is Richard Parker.

915
01:32:45,481 --> 01:32:49,913
Whatever lies will be told about me,
I would like the world to know the truth.

916
01:32:50,049 --> 01:32:53,362
<i>Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research...</i>

917
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:58,478
When Norman Osborn made a deal with
a foreign military organization.

918
01:32:58,602 --> 01:33:01,242
To continue funding my research..

919
01:33:01,211 --> 01:33:03,952
I found out what they were going to
it for.

920
01:33:03,977 --> 01:33:07,884
Weapons.. Biological weapons, of course.
So I refused.

921
01:33:07,953 --> 01:33:11,442
Now to get me out of the picture..

922
01:33:11,608 --> 01:33:15,592
Norman Osborn, has
falseified evidence against me...

923
01:33:15,758 --> 01:33:19,363
In order to take control,
of my work.

924
01:33:22,845 --> 01:33:24,355
Can I help you?

925
01:33:24,524 --> 01:33:28,548
Yeh you can open the gate.
I'm Harry Osborn.

926
01:33:28,673 --> 01:33:32,574
Theres a patient, that I specially
would like to see.

927
01:33:32,782 --> 01:33:35,717
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn Oscorp.

928
01:33:35,874 --> 01:33:38,805
Sorry, Sir, without a yellow badge,
you can't come in here.

929
01:33:42,257 --> 01:33:47,539
It doesn't matter, because there is
something else that Norman doesn't know.

930
01:33:49,008 --> 01:33:53,869
The Human DNA, that I implanted in
the spiders...

931
01:33:55,423 --> 01:33:57,090
was my own.

932
01:33:59,448 --> 01:34:03,683
Which means that without me
without my bloodline...

933
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:08,081
Oscorp can never replicate or
continue my experiments.

934
01:34:08,363 --> 01:34:10,879
With Electro integrated.

935
01:34:11,347 --> 01:34:15,542
400 milligrams of sodium
and phenobarbital.

936
01:34:17,004 --> 01:34:21,053
I've destroyed as much as possible
from the archives...

937
01:34:21,063 --> 01:34:24,094
but I didn't have time
to kill all the spiders.

938
01:34:24,598 --> 01:34:27,323
As a scientist, my choice is very clear
now.

939
01:34:27,532 --> 01:34:31,304
I have to disappear. I have to get
as Far away from here, as I can.

940
01:34:31,353 --> 01:34:33,365
But as a father...

941
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:36,798
It Means, I may not see my boy
again..

942
01:34:38,414 --> 01:34:43,793
Nothing is as important to me,
as my son, Peter.

943
01:34:44,008 --> 01:34:45,727
Nothing in this world.

944
01:34:46,243 --> 01:34:50,557
But I have a responsibility to protect
the world, from what I've created.

945
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:53,649
And protect him from what
I know Osborn, is capable of.

946
01:34:54,635 --> 01:34:57,066
People will say I'm a monster...

947
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,020
for what I've done.

948
01:35:01,324 --> 01:35:03,207
Maybe they're right.

949
01:35:05,379 --> 01:35:08,986
I always thought that I'd have more time.

950
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:12,555
DAD!!...DAD!... I'm sorry.

951
01:35:30,764 --> 01:35:33,209
Anesthesia... off

952
01:35:39,802 --> 01:35:44,327
I'm gonna get you out,
But we haven't much time.

953
01:35:44,627 --> 01:35:49,071
Who are you? - I'm Harry Osborn.
I want to make you a deal.

954
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:54,602
- I should kill you.
- Come on.

955
01:35:55,065 --> 01:35:59,299
Think, Max.
I'm not the one you want.

956
01:35:59,464 --> 01:36:03,961
You want Spider-Man.
And I can give him to you.

957
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:09,652
But... I need something first..

958
01:36:11,117 --> 01:36:13,378
I need you to get me to Oscorp.

959
01:36:13,415 --> 01:36:17,052
Get you Inside? You own it.

960
01:36:18,063 --> 01:36:20,579
Not anymore.
Oscorp betrayed us both.

961
01:36:20,704 --> 01:36:24,928
So I can't get in there without you, And
you can't get out of here without me.

962
01:36:25,861 --> 01:36:28,301
What's happening? Someone triggered
an alarm in the iso unit..

963
01:36:28,326 --> 01:36:31,127
Get a containment team in there now..

964
01:36:32,016 --> 01:36:33,951
You can't possibly know what I want.

965
01:36:33,983 --> 01:36:37,758
You improved the design to the grid, and
they stole it, and now you want it back.

966
01:36:37,759 --> 01:36:39,473
You just wanna take what's
yours.

967
01:36:39,911 --> 01:36:44,935
All the power is in the city, Max,
and its right at your fingertips.

968
01:36:45,377 --> 01:36:47,377
Once you have completed the
electricity network...

969
01:36:47,402 --> 01:36:51,342
Spider-Man will come to you, bleed
him.

970
01:36:53,304 --> 01:36:55,015
Break the glass.

971
01:36:57,402 --> 01:36:59,745
Max, we don't have much time.

972
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:00,596
Go... go... go.

973
01:37:01,655 --> 01:37:05,294
One reason why I should I trust you?
Because I need you.

974
01:37:07,153 --> 01:37:11,081
- You need me?
- Yeah, I need you.

975
01:37:11,106 --> 01:37:15,215
You are my only chance, that
I have of surviving.

976
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,743
- You need me?
- Yes, I need you.

977
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:21,923
I need you. Please.

978
01:37:23,532 --> 01:37:26,844
I know what its like to be thrown away..
Please!!! MAX!!

979
01:37:26,869 --> 01:37:29,631
I need you. I need you.

980
01:38:25,207 --> 01:38:26,885
You will you be my friend?

981
01:38:27,410 --> 01:38:29,588
I thought we were already?

982
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:33,359
I had a friend once.

983
01:38:33,737 --> 01:38:35,890
It didn't work out.

984
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:38,023
Yeah, me too.

985
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:42,131
Let us go catch a spider.

986
01:38:44,765 --> 01:38:47,240
You have one new voice message.

987
01:38:49,587 --> 01:38:52,473
Hi, Peter, Its me.

988
01:38:53,486 --> 01:38:57,296
I got in to Oxford. Woo-hoo.

989
01:38:58,967 --> 01:39:01,102
Very exciting

990
01:39:00,724 --> 01:39:06,440
I came by your house, a little bit
ago And I..You weren't there. And so

991
01:39:06,916 --> 01:39:09,311
I'm on my way to the airport...
Right now.

992
01:39:09,336 --> 01:39:12,345
Because there's a summer
conferance, I had read about

993
01:39:12,370 --> 01:39:15,517
and I thought that it would
somehow.

994
01:39:15,852 --> 01:39:19,877
Be easier, I guess, this way.

995
01:39:20,504 --> 01:39:26,737
I think that maybe its time to,
let us go...

996
01:39:26,804 --> 01:39:32,717
And thats not because I don't love you,
but its actually because I do.

997
01:39:33,546 --> 01:39:35,533
Goodbye..

998
01:39:49,161 --> 01:39:52,053
We have to move now.
Why... Whats happened?

999
01:40:04,943 --> 01:40:06,842
Remember me?

1000
01:40:10,985 --> 01:40:14,507
Ohhh, my oh my, how the tables have
turned.

1001
01:40:15,274 --> 01:40:19,825
I know it's hard to admit... But ahh
spectacular.

1002
01:40:19,854 --> 01:40:23,994
Move into this..Am I right?
Right thats right.

1003
01:40:27,888 --> 01:40:30,245
So... Dear godfather..

1004
01:40:30,326 --> 01:40:33,341
It's time to create me a wish.

1005
01:40:33,366 --> 01:40:38,713
I want in to special
...- How dare you come back here?

1006
01:40:38,765 --> 01:40:43,921
You, unworthy, defective.

1007
01:40:46,898 --> 01:40:51,383
Ohh..Sorry, that's not the answer
what we were looking for.

1008
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:08,477
"Clear."

1009
01:41:08,711 --> 01:41:11,687
Welome back to the bonus round.

1010
01:41:14,162 --> 01:41:16,733
Let's take a walk. Shall we...

1011
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:24,137
The grid is all yours.

1012
01:41:55,514 --> 01:41:58,436
Spider-Man. Give it to me.

1013
01:42:03,812 --> 01:42:07,202
- What is this?
- The future.

1014
01:42:20,982 --> 01:42:23,092
Rope one on..

1015
01:42:26,128 --> 01:42:30,643
It won't work.
We're in heavy diagnostic test.

1016
01:42:30,668 --> 01:42:34,824
Apart from human trials. You've
actually already run human trials...

1017
01:42:34,863 --> 01:42:37,988
you're just too stupid to know it.

1018
01:42:39,527 --> 01:42:42,612
Do it. Now.

1019
01:43:01,977 --> 01:43:04,469
You've had all this time.

1020
01:44:20,447 --> 01:44:22,018
CRITICAL INJURY DETECTED

1021
01:44:22,043 --> 01:44:23,687
HEALING PROTOCOL ACTIVATED

1022
01:44:33,362 --> 01:44:35,133
It's Spider-Man.

1023
01:44:40,783 --> 01:44:44,221
Stop the cab.
Wait I aint even moving...

1024
01:44:59,685 --> 01:45:02,075
I LOVE YOU

1025
01:45:16,937 --> 01:45:19,324
Did you get my message?
What message?

1026
01:45:19,349 --> 01:45:21,698
The message from above.
Wow-that was you?

1027
01:45:21,705 --> 01:45:23,892
Don't go. Let the world get off.

1028
01:45:23,961 --> 01:45:26,143
It says that 'I love you'.

1029
01:45:28,117 --> 01:45:29,795
Because I love you.

1030
01:45:30,842 --> 01:45:33,486
No offense, but you're wrong.

1031
01:45:33,611 --> 01:45:37,591
You're my path, you're my path.

1032
01:45:38,898 --> 01:45:41,179
You and I will always be togetherl.

1033
01:45:42,248 --> 01:45:45,771
I know there are a million reasons
why we shouldn't be together.

1034
01:45:45,844 --> 01:45:47,783
But I'm tired.

1035
01:45:50,228 --> 01:45:52,495
I'm tired of everything.

1036
01:45:52,983 --> 01:45:55,249
Of having to make a choice.

1037
01:45:56,828 --> 01:45:58,494
And I choose you.

1038
01:46:00,818 --> 01:46:02,505
So...

1039
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:05,344
heres my thought.

1040
01:46:05,991 --> 01:46:07,533
England.

1041
01:46:08,628 --> 01:46:10,330
Both of us.

1042
01:46:11,846 --> 01:46:15,914
I'm following you now.
I'm just going to follow you everywhere..

1043
01:46:16,316 --> 01:46:18,603
I'm just going to follow you
the rest of my life..

1044
01:46:19,546 --> 01:46:22,858
They got crime there. In England..

1045
01:46:23,081 --> 01:46:25,637
Apparently They have tons of crime.

1046
01:46:25,687 --> 01:46:29,764
Yeh I know... Jack the Ripper.

1047
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:35,005
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper, he's
still in London..

1048
01:46:53,071 --> 01:46:55,383
What the hell is that?

1049
01:47:05,153 --> 01:47:07,223
Is that Max?

1050
01:47:07,248 --> 01:47:10,150
He ​might just cut power to the city

1051
01:47:22,324 --> 01:47:24,755
I need tech-ops up here right now.

1052
01:47:24,959 --> 01:47:28,021
Phone lines are down. Someone
go down and grab. Tech-ops...

1053
01:47:28,046 --> 01:47:29,920
Hey... write down what you remember,
people.

1054
01:47:29,945 --> 01:47:32,647
There's gotta be some sort
of a backup plan, right?

1055
01:47:33,223 --> 01:47:36,558
There is an emergency generator.

1056
01:47:36,781 --> 01:47:39,186
The transmission lines

1057
01:47:39,211 --> 01:47:41,321
they're never gonna get the backup.
How can I stop him?

1058
01:47:41,346 --> 01:47:43,622
Every time I get close, to him
he fries my webshoots.

1059
01:47:43,647 --> 01:47:46,459
Have you tried to stop him?
Yes, rubber, plastic...

1060
01:47:46,484 --> 01:47:50,256
Did you try to magnetizing him?
I didn't... Try magnetizing him.

1061
01:47:50,679 --> 01:47:52,860
Okay well, remember eighth grade?
Final class...

1062
01:47:53,285 --> 01:47:56,099
If you magnetizes him now
with a battery...

1063
01:47:56,124 --> 01:47:58,325
You cause an electric short.
Yes...

1064
01:48:00,261 --> 01:48:04,085
Approach, this is Pan National 273
on approach..

1065
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:06,088
How do you hear?

1066
01:48:06,187 --> 01:48:09,709
Approach, do you copy
radio's working its not us..

1067
01:48:16,675 --> 01:48:21,456
There is no reason to panic.
Go back to your vehicle.

1068
01:48:21,581 --> 01:48:25,227
Go back to your car and stay calm.

1069
01:48:26,652 --> 01:48:29,377
Everyone go back to your vehicles.

1070
01:48:30,212 --> 01:48:32,309
- Agent.
- Spider-Man.

1071
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:37,101
My father was superintendent George Stacy. Yeh
I know who he was. What can we do for you?

1072
01:48:37,102 --> 01:48:40,331
Jumper cables, Jumper cables!! Yes
and copper wire.

1073
01:48:40,659 --> 01:48:44,894
Am I talking louder than I
usually talk right now - Yes.

1074
01:48:45,283 --> 01:48:47,931
You'll get over.

1075
01:48:51,224 --> 01:48:54,114
Try. Move.

1076
01:48:54,324 --> 01:48:58,348
Okay It works now. And why you
were number two in school.

1077
01:49:00,699 --> 01:49:02,458
- I have to go.
- I'm with you.

1078
01:49:02,627 --> 01:49:05,252
You're not coming with me. Yes I know
Sorry... It's too dangerous.

1079
01:49:05,277 --> 01:49:08,209
I'm with you
and I know how to reset the system.

1080
01:49:08,274 --> 01:49:11,377
I'm coming with you.
You know that you need me.

1081
01:49:12,002 --> 01:49:14,308
Then go with it.
Close the bonnet.

1082
01:49:14,385 --> 01:49:16,590
Sorry, I love you.
Don't hate me.

1083
01:49:19,514 --> 01:49:23,076
We still have no spare units.
Take the technicians.

1084
01:49:23,459 --> 01:49:27,753
I need a respirator right now I'll
get the battery operated. Hang on!

1085
01:49:52,073 --> 01:49:54,339
Can you see me now, Spider-Man?

1086
01:49:54,673 --> 01:49:58,671
It is time to meet our
destinies.

1087
01:50:13,625 --> 01:50:18,991
We're experiencing electrical disturbance.
Instruments are going haywire radar is down.

1088
01:50:19,323 --> 01:50:22,070
We're flying blind out here
do you copy?

1089
01:50:26,197 --> 01:50:28,633
Tower We are standing by
What is happening?

1090
01:50:29,589 --> 01:50:32,195
Aircraft, on intersecting path.

1091
01:50:32,196 --> 01:50:34,551
Time to impact?
Four and a half minutes.

1092
01:50:34,552 --> 01:50:36,186
Clock it... Clock it right now Now.

1093
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:53,788
You're late, Spider-Man.
I've designed this power grid.

1094
01:50:53,913 --> 01:50:57,559
Now I'm gonna take back what,
what is rightfully mine.

1095
01:50:57,894 --> 01:51:00,116
I want control of everything.

1096
01:51:00,329 --> 01:51:05,871
And I will be like a God for his.
A God named "Sparkles?"

1097
01:51:15,925 --> 01:51:19,618
Not this time. Is that all you've got?
Come on!!!

1098
01:51:39,128 --> 01:51:40,703
Come on.

1099
01:51:44,408 --> 01:51:46,386
You ready to give up?

1100
01:51:56,341 --> 01:51:58,857
Ohh Thank-You, Gwen Stacy.

1101
01:52:09,242 --> 01:52:13,911
Shake it off. It's your bones,
muscles and your organs.

1102
01:52:17,373 --> 01:52:17,873
Ohh boy

1103
01:52:26,250 --> 01:52:28,281
I hate this song.

1104
01:52:47,932 --> 01:52:51,432
Spider-Man, bet you never
saw this coming..

1105
01:52:57,868 --> 01:52:59,525
Are you serious?

1106
01:52:59,544 --> 01:53:02,538
You wire me to a car,
What are you a caveman.

1107
01:53:02,867 --> 01:53:06,138
You tie me up, to go off to war
I outa help you.

1108
01:53:06,635 --> 01:53:10,366
I know the grid down.
I can reset the system.

1109
01:53:10,699 --> 01:53:14,680
You can't be here right now I'm not messing
around. You can't be here right now.

1110
01:53:14,802 --> 01:53:17,862
Nobody makes my decisions.
For me, alright... Nobody..

1111
01:53:17,913 --> 01:53:19,879
This is my choice okay...

1112
01:53:20,635 --> 01:53:23,026
My choice, mine...

1113
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:25,397
Now how do we stop him?

1114
01:53:25,667 --> 01:53:29,188
He is like a battery. So What happens
when you overcharge a battery?

1115
01:53:29,397 --> 01:53:32,920
It explodes... Right..So We
use his power against him. Perfect.

1116
01:53:32,945 --> 01:53:36,735
Okay I need to re-connect power,
I need you to reset the system.

1117
01:53:36,736 --> 01:53:42,070
Okay when I say you turn that power on, you turn
it on. No matter what. Peter, no matter what.

1118
01:53:46,592 --> 01:53:48,294
Go!! Go!

1119
01:54:39,849 --> 01:54:41,902
60 seconds to impact.

1120
01:55:16,707 --> 01:55:19,457
Now, Gwen. Do it nowwww.

1121
01:55:39,318 --> 01:55:41,081
OVERLOAD

1122
01:55:45,033 --> 01:55:46,711
Unit 687.

1123
01:55:56,681 --> 01:56:00,211
This is La guardia tower.turn
immediately, heading 280.

1124
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:04,894
Incoming traffic, I repeat 280.

1125
01:56:22,182 --> 01:56:24,448
Get back to work, lets
land these planes.

1126
01:56:24,613 --> 01:56:26,247
I'll be back.

1127
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:31,596
We're back in the air. Back
to work everybody lets go.

1128
01:57:07,090 --> 01:57:09,281
Hello are you still making a fight.

1129
01:57:17,805 --> 01:57:19,907
Gwen, stay there.

1130
01:57:45,521 --> 01:57:46,021
Peter.

1131
01:57:47,515 --> 01:57:50,702
When you said: Spider-Man, said no

1132
01:57:51,135 --> 01:57:55,205
you meant "you" said "no"

1133
01:57:55,438 --> 01:57:58,129
Harry, what did you just do?

1134
01:57:58,217 --> 01:58:00,273
What you made me do.

1135
01:58:00,413 --> 01:58:04,947
You were my friend and you betrayed me.

1136
01:58:05,127 --> 01:58:08,689
No, I was trying to protect you.

1137
01:58:09,315 --> 01:58:12,961
Look at me. Harry. Its gonna be Okay.
Its gonna be alright..

1138
01:58:13,024 --> 01:58:16,876
You give people no hope.
You take it away.

1139
01:58:17,037 --> 01:58:20,724
No, Harry. And now I'm going
to take away yours...

1140
01:58:20,817 --> 01:58:22,476
Gwen... Run...

1141
01:58:24,611 --> 01:58:26,394
Harry, put her down.

1142
01:58:42,566 --> 01:58:44,153
Harry, Stop this right now.

1143
01:58:44,178 --> 01:58:47,407
Harry put her down, this is
not you, Harry Put her down.

1144
01:58:48,342 --> 01:58:50,354
Harry's dead.

1145
01:58:50,379 --> 01:58:53,438
Harry This is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1146
01:58:53,544 --> 01:58:55,640
Fight me, let her go.

1147
01:59:07,419 --> 01:59:09,488
You're okay?

1148
01:59:13,957 --> 01:59:16,700
I got you. I put you down now.

1149
02:02:05,456 --> 02:02:06,966
Breathe..

1150
02:02:19,356 --> 02:02:21,368
You'll be fine.

1151
02:02:31,182 --> 02:02:35,814
Stay with me. Stay with me

1152
02:02:45,003 --> 02:02:45,503
Gwen

1153
02:02:48,598 --> 02:02:51,198
Gwen... please.

1154
02:02:53,617 --> 02:02:55,523
Please.

1155
02:03:02,012 --> 02:03:04,238
I can't do without you.

1156
02:05:07,007 --> 02:05:09,136
Leave us.

1157
02:05:12,822 --> 02:05:14,794
Have you made progress?

1158
02:05:14,819 --> 02:05:18,171
I've examined some worthy
candidates.

1159
02:05:18,285 --> 02:05:20,422
Now that Spider-Man's gone...

1160
02:05:20,591 --> 02:05:23,775
this city will never be the same.

1161
02:05:24,229 --> 02:05:26,745
Ohh..I'm counting on that.

1162
02:05:26,909 --> 02:05:29,848
Speaking of progress,
you're looking better.

1163
02:05:30,810 --> 02:05:32,657
It comes and goes.

1164
02:05:34,332 --> 02:05:35,926
Tell me more.

1165
02:05:36,269 --> 02:05:40,128
How many men did you have in mind?
I want to keep it small.

1166
02:05:40,293 --> 02:05:43,735
Everything you need is already at Oscorp.

1167
02:05:45,569 --> 02:05:49,594
<i>Access granted.
Welcome, Mr. Fiers.</i>

1168
02:05:49,632 --> 02:05:53,704
<i>Who is the first volunteer?
Aleksei Sytsevich.</i>

1169
02:05:53,728 --> 02:05:55,990
<i>Apparently serving a
life sentence.</i>

1170
02:05:56,162 --> 02:05:59,892
<i>He was eager to join us.</i>

1171
02:06:00,535 --> 02:06:02,137
<i>Good.</i>

1172
02:06:02,578 --> 02:06:04,590
<i>Start with him.</i>

1173
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:10,226
<i>Russian Aleksei Sytsevich was broken. Out of a
classified penetentiary known simply as 'The Vault'..</i>

1174
02:06:10,469 --> 02:06:12,064
By an unknown team of men.

1175
02:06:12,395 --> 02:06:15,164
Its yet Another example of
increased criminal activity.

1176
02:06:15,189 --> 02:06:18,500
Since the disappearance of Spider-Man
5 months months ago..

1177
02:06:18,525 --> 02:06:21,845
The webslingers absence has
left a hole in the heart of our city.

1178
02:06:21,970 --> 02:06:26,329
Believe it or not even the New York city Police
Department has joined the chorus of New Yorkers...

1179
02:06:26,554 --> 02:06:29,005
In hoping for the return of webslinger...

1180
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:31,969
The entire world seems to be asking
the same question:

1181
02:06:32,073 --> 02:06:34,171
Where is Spider-Man.

1182
02:06:35,131 --> 02:06:37,606
Its wrong that spider-guy.

1183
02:06:39,515 --> 02:06:42,816
Since he's disappeared seems like,
everybody really needs him.

1184
02:06:44,461 --> 02:06:46,124
Where you going?

1185
02:06:46,937 --> 02:06:49,618
- I'm not sure.
- Peter...

1186
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:52,053
Where are you going?

1187
02:07:01,251 --> 02:07:02,826
I don't know.

1188
02:07:04,649 --> 02:07:06,367
It's not funny...

1189
02:07:07,252 --> 02:07:10,101
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organised...

1190
02:07:10,168 --> 02:07:14,990
Clean some of Bens stuff.
In boxes..

1191
02:07:15,424 --> 02:07:19,195
Funny the heavier the box gets,
the lighter I feel.

1192
02:07:19,807 --> 02:07:22,429
You throwing his stuff away?

1193
02:07:23,712 --> 02:07:26,856
I couldn't. Do that
It's a part of me.

1194
02:07:27,714 --> 02:07:30,648
It's just... Finding...

1195
02:07:31,790 --> 02:07:33,300
a better place for them.

1196
02:07:37,035 --> 02:07:39,519
I'm gonna take one last look...

1197
02:07:39,863 --> 02:07:42,611
and put them away where they belong.

1198
02:08:00,951 --> 02:08:02,622
Gwen's speech.

1199
02:08:07,294 --> 02:08:11,488
It is easy feel hopeful
on a beautiful day like today.

1200
02:08:12,404 --> 02:08:15,298
But there will be Dark days ahead of us
to.

1201
02:08:16,479 --> 02:08:19,337
And there will be days when you
feel all alone.

1202
02:08:21,551 --> 02:08:24,026
Thats when hope is needed
most...

1203
02:08:25,491 --> 02:08:27,548
no matter how heavy it gets..

1204
02:08:28,385 --> 02:08:32,450
Or how lost you feel, you must promise me..

1205
02:08:32,659 --> 02:08:36,016
That you will hope on.

1206
02:08:37,521 --> 02:08:39,292
Keep it alive.

1207
02:08:39,653 --> 02:08:42,642
We have to be greater
than what we suffer..

1208
02:08:42,766 --> 02:08:46,666
I wish for you that you become
hope.

1209
02:08:46,925 --> 02:08:48,937
People need that.

1210
02:08:49,543 --> 02:08:54,194
And even if we fail, what better way
is there to live..

1211
02:08:55,331 --> 02:08:57,344
As we look around here today.

1212
02:08:57,509 --> 02:09:00,737
And all of the people who help to
make us who we are..

1213
02:09:01,409 --> 02:09:04,324
I know it feels like we're
saying 'goodbye'

1214
02:09:04,844 --> 02:09:10,610
But we carry a piece of each other into
everything that we do next..

1215
02:09:11,806 --> 02:09:14,824
To remind us, of who we are...

1216
02:09:16,671 --> 02:09:18,475
and if we were meant to be..

1217
02:09:20,821 --> 02:09:25,265
I had a great 4 years with
you, I'll miss you all very much.

1218
02:09:47,412 --> 02:09:49,330
Move out of the way.

1219
02:10:02,380 --> 02:10:06,783
I'm here live on Park Avenue and 56th
Street where there is complete chaos...

1220
02:10:07,292 --> 02:10:11,193
<i>A man in some sort of weaponised
armoured suit, is wreaking havoc on</i>

1221
02:10:15,058 --> 02:10:20,383
I'm Rhino.
I told you I would be back.

1222
02:10:38,532 --> 02:10:42,484
Hold your fire.
Everybody hold your fire.

1223
02:10:49,335 --> 02:10:51,732
Boy, you have to...

1224
02:10:53,047 --> 02:10:54,847
Look, New York.

1225
02:10:54,943 --> 02:10:57,311
Spider-Man is back.

1226
02:10:58,488 --> 02:11:00,500
That's my son.

1227
02:11:03,544 --> 02:11:05,681
Brave boy. Huh.

1228
02:11:05,808 --> 02:11:08,114
Does Aleksei Makes scare you, little
boy?

1229
02:11:25,642 --> 02:11:27,421
Hey, Spider-Man.

1230
02:11:37,412 --> 02:11:41,607
I knew you'd come back. Thanks
for stepping up for me.

1231
02:11:41,623 --> 02:11:44,246
You are the bravest kid
I've ever seen.

1232
02:11:44,247 --> 02:11:47,102
I'm gonna take care of him, so you
can take care of your mom... Okay...

1233
02:11:47,181 --> 02:11:49,697
Alright get out of here your gone.

1234
02:11:56,785 --> 02:12:00,376
Do you want to fight with.
You will fight me now?

1235
02:12:01,337 --> 02:12:04,879
On Behalf of the fine people of New
York city and real rhinos everywhere...

1236
02:12:04,904 --> 02:12:08,187
I ask you to turn your mechanised
palms in the air.

1237
02:12:08,212 --> 02:12:12,531
Never. I crush you and
kill you and destroy.

1238
02:12:12,700 --> 02:12:15,509
You're gonna have to come down here
so you can kill me? Yes...

1239
02:12:15,678 --> 02:12:18,941
I'll be right there..There's
No place like home.
